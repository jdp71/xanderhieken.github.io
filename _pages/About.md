I'm a graduate student at Bellevue University working toward a Master of Science in Data Science- graduating in May 2020.

With a strong background in financial analysis and sales, I've gained experience in statistical programming, machine learning, and AI to evolve and remain agile in the era of Big Data.

Whether you need someone to design an experiment from scratch or make sure your data is cleaned and ready for a complex machine learning algorithm, I'm ready to hit the ground running and create immediate value for your team.

Feel free to reach out via the email link on the left of this page with any questions or opportunities- I typically respond immediately.
